Hello, create a web page with javascript that reverses the order of a string. This string will come from an input and you should use two files as seed, one index.html with the following content:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Reverse String</title>    
</head>
<body>
<script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

And you should add the solution of this exercise in the script.js file. Also please add some good style for the input:
- Center it in the screen horizontal and vertical
- Add a button with color blue
- The input should has some size
- The result should be in a container with some color as a background
- When you click enter in the keyboard should trigger the button
